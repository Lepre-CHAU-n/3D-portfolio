## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

This was a project I started so I could learn more on Three.js, which I learned quite a lot. I learned how to implement 3D libaries and animated designs into my website, as well as adding a star background which you can interact through the cursor. Futhermore, I gained hands-on experience in crafting immersive web experiences through React and Tailwind CSS. I was inspired by [https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_3D_developer_portfolio]
