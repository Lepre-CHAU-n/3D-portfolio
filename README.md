This was a project I started so I could learn more about Three.js, which I learned quite a lot. I learned how to implement 3D libraries and animated designs into my website, as well as add a star background which you can interact with through the cursor. Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience in crafting immersive web experiences through React and Tailwind CSS. I was inspired by [here](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_3D_developer_portfolio)
